            <li>Blase was very enthusiastic and friendly. His lectures were clear and up-to-date and had tangible real-world examples.</li>

            <li>Blase clearly really cares about the topic and probably knows more about it than almost anyone else teaching in the US. He is a very engaging lecturer, and did a great job of adapting a CMU curriculum to the UChicago quarter system. He is always willing to take questions/comments from the class, even if not directly relevant to the current discussion and overall very supportive of participation. </li>

            <li>He can be a little scattered, allowing discussion to wander or take up too much time. He was still adjusting to the quarter system, so it felt like everything was a bit squished.</li>

            <li>He occasionally planned too much material for one lecture, so the lectures had to be cut short. This is understandable since this was his first time teaching on the quarter system and he definitely got better as the quarter went along so he should be even better during future quarters.</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>Didn&#39;t seem to have a very structured vision for the class - it felt like assorted topics in HCI with a focus on security.</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>Only two: he struggled at the start of the course with the length of his lectures. Now that you&#39;ve had a run through of the class in the quarter system context, I&#39;d strongly suggest changing those lectures which tended to be either too long, filled with content, or which the class didn&#39;t seem very involved in. Second, with regard to test answers--in many cases my classmates and I found ourselves losing points for answers which, though correct, didn&#39;t quite match Blase&#39;s full answer. This lead to partial (or no) credit on questions which, to me, were much more open-ended than they were graded. I&#39;d suggest using a practice exam or explicitly giving instructions before exams so that this confusion doesn&#39;t arise, or, on the more lenient end, grading the exams more open-ended. In any case, more communication needs to happen so that your exams are more understandable for students, at least the first time they take one.</li>

            <li>Most of the weaknesses were due to this being the first class he&#39;s taught at this school. The classes felt like they were designed for a semester long course rather than for a quarter. Classes were paced pretty slowly, a lot of time was spent on explaining and re-explaining simple things (explaining a scientific experiment, conducting a study) but not much time was allotted for more advanced topics (statistical tests, actual security concepts). The psets also tended to be very long and felt repetitive or like busy work, but after a mid-quarter evaluation the final pset was severely shortened down and felt like an adequate amount of work without being repetitive.</li>

There was also a group project that started about half way through the quarter and ended during finals week. While I can see why this was a group project (research experiments would usually be carried out by groups, a single person wouldn&#39;t be able to do that much work, etc.) it was really rough trying to coordinate the project with group members, especially because there were so many things that were due and every project member had so many other things on their plate.</li>

            <li>Make it more clear whether the class is about holding research studies, or the academic fields of usable security. It seems really difficult to do both, and made it confusing for students who expected one but not the other. If the academic side, could benefit from more in-depth information, because a lot of the stuff Blase covered in lecture were basic tech-interest info that CS-majors or minors would know already.

Literally the TA&#39;s just signed off on the homeworks as long as you did it, wrote enough, and/or included the right buzzwords, and gave you 95-100%. This sounds nice except for the fact that it led to some surprises when it came time to take the exams, since we not basically no meaningful feedback on homework. Maybe assign project groups at the beginning of the class, and have the groups do the homeworks together, so that the course staff will be able to take more time giving feedback on them.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#39;t a fan of the quizzes every class. I don&#39;t think they were a very good metric for understanding materials or even the papers themselves. Also I think the psets often felt like busy work.</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>Some reorganization of the presentations would be nice. It was Blase&#39;s first time teaching the class at UChicago, so curriculum didn&#39;t quite fit well with the quarter system. I&#39;m sure this will be better next year though.</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>I liked the group project but its scheduling needs a little more adjustment. Some of the HW questions were sort of busy-workish (time consuming but not very engaging)</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>Reduce the size of the homeworks. Focus less on the study aspect of usable security and more on the hci implementation details.</li>
        
    
    

    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            <li>Shorten down the psets, if possible make the group project simpler or at least have fewer deliverables. I would also really have appreciated getting more of a primer on security because, although this is NOT a security class, many of the topics are of course related to computer security and I was largely unfamiliar with the concepts since I hadn&#39;t been able to get into a security class previously.</li>
